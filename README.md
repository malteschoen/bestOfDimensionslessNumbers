## Fourier / Graetz number
- is my transient process thermally converged?
- if not, what is the temperature differential in degrees celsius?
- can my melt stream be thermally controlled by the walls?
- 
## Biot number 
- is my thin sheet/film/tube etc. thermally homogenous?
- 
## Inertial number I
- will my pellet flow choke?
- 
## Deborah number
- is my transient process relaxed, causing it to behave like a Newtonian fluid 
- 
## deformational-relaxational Weißenberg number
- where am I on the viscosity curve of my steady-state-process?
- 
## stress Weißenberg number
- are normal stresses relevant to our problem?

##  Nahme number
-  is my rheological measurement affected by viscous dissipation?

## Manas-Zlocower index
-  is  my flow shear- or elongation-dominated?

##  elongational parameter epsilon from PTT models
-  how strong can the normal stresses become?
